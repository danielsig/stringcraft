A Component based game engine that uses the System.Console for text graphics like this...
```
____ ___ ____ _ _  _ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ___ 
[__   |  |__/ | |\ | | __ |    |__/ |__| |___  |  
___]  |  |  \ | | \| |__] |___ |  \ |  | |     |  
                                                  
```
The architecture of the framework is roughly based on the Unity 3D framework and uses gameobjects, components, messages, update/fixedUpdate and so on.
